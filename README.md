# YelpPlace
This project is from a course by Colt Steele, The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022. He made YelpCamp as a big project of the course where we used all things he learned us through out of course. I recreated it to YelpPlace, a webpage where you can find place to live based on users reviews. Works on PC.
