# YelpPlace
This project is from a course by Colt Steele, "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022" on Udemy. Colt made YelpCamp as a big project of the course where we used all things he learned us through out of the course. YelpCamp is a website where you can find, post and write reviews about camping sites. I recreated it to YelpPlace, a webpage where you can find place to live based on users reviews.
